I prefer to choose Claude Monet - 'Saint Georges majeur au crépuscule' as the main project. The colorful straight or curved lines and their arrangement in the example can be applied to this project. Although the lines are simple, they are powerful to outline the picture vividly. This is an effective way to encode landscape artworks. For example, in the Claude Monet’s artwork, straight lines arranged vertically represent the sky, and curved lines arranged horizontally represent the ocean. Clear partitions combined with modular codes can not only display pictures vividly, but also make the coding process clear and logical.
